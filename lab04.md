# Grading and collecting assignments
In this section you will be able to collect and grade some assignments.

## Collecting assignments
In the previous section you assigned some coursework and shared materials with your peers.

After an assignment has been made, you will notice a **Collect** button next to it.

If you click on this button you will generate a copy of the student's assignment in your own directory as well as the extra files (s)he might have generated.

## Grading
You can now open and mark the student's assignment. You can annotate the assignments as you please and the students will get a copy of everything you have added once you return the assignments.

A convenient way to annotate the assignments is to use the markdown cells and use HTML tags (e.g. to change the font colour).

```html
<font color ="red"> Great work! </font>
```
Once you are done you can return to the .project file and mark it by clicking in *Enter grade* and assign an appropriate mark.

## Returning an assignment
After grading an assignment click on the **Return** button and a copy of your modified file will be added to the student's project.

## Exercise
Remember the assignments you assigned to your peers? Hopefully they will now include some modifications. Collect them and grade them. Once completed, return them to whoever it was assigned.

## Extra-exercise
Export the grades from your course work in either a .csv file or as a Python file. (Hint: this is not done in your .course file but directly on the project Settings.)
