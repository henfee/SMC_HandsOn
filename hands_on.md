# Introduction to using SageMathCloud for lectures

As part of the [OpenDreamKit Project](http://opendreamkit.org),

This tutorial is intended to help lecturers to explore the main functionalities of SMC with regards to course management.

Through this hands-on tutorial you will learn to:
* Set up a course and create the main directories
* Use GitHub to populate your course (as well as for version control)
* Add collaborators and students
* Assign, collect, and mark coursework

If you are interested in having a member of the RSE team delivering this tutorial in your department/faculty please email us: rse@sheffield.ac.uk
