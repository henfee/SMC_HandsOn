# Introduction to using SageMathCloud for lectures

As part of the [OpenDreamKit Project](http://opendreamkit.org),
the RSES has developed a hands-on tutorial for lecturers willing to use SMC to deliver their lectures.

This tutorial is intended to help lecturers to explore the min functionalities of SMC and allow them to set up a fully functional course in SMC.

Through this hands-on tutorial you will learn to:
* Set up a course and create the main directories
* Use GitHub to populate your course and keep version control
* Add collaborators and students
* Assign, collect, and mark coursework
* Use various means to interact with students and collaborators

If you are interested in having a member of the RSE team delivering this tutorial in your department/faculty please email us: rse@sheffield.ac.uk

If you encounter any problems with this tutorial please rise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/trallard/SMC_HandsOn)

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have created a SageMathCloud account beforehand.

Familiarity with the use of command line (very basic) and git.
