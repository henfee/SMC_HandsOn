# Hands on session
This tutorial is intended to help you set up a basic course in SageMathCloud. It is based on the previous sections presented in this tutorial.

For advanced features please refer to the relevant sections in this tutorial or contact the staff at SageMathCloud directly.

## Getting you started
1. Make sure you have created an account in [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/).
- We will be adding collaborators and students to this tutorial project so make sure you have provided your email address to the instructor (this needs to the the same email address you used to create your SMC account).
- Create a new course named **SMC_hands_on** and make sure you add a meaningful description.

## Managing your course
We will first create the basic structure of your course, which will look something like this:
  - notes
    - week1
  - data
    - data set 1
  - assignments
    - week1
    - week2

(Note this is a suggested basic structure, which has been proved to be useful for some people. You can always add directories to satisfy your needs e.g. supplementary material, demo codes, etc.)

1.  Start by creating your basic directory structure. Remember you can create directories and subdirectories by using the appropriate terminal commands: `mkdir notes/notes1`
